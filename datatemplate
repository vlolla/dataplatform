- What systems are they?
- In what domain does it reside (internal/external/other)?
- How will you be accessing data from these systems from  Platform?
- What is the frequency of accessing this data?
- What size/quantity of data is ingested (GB/Day, GB in total)
   - Summarizing the quantity of data in terms of total rows/records and size in GBs. 

#### Downstream Targets

Describe where your data will end up.  Some things to think about (non-exhaustive):

- Does data need to return to targets outside of DataHub?
- How will the data get back to those targets?
- What size/quantity of data is egressed/consumed (GB/Day, GB in total)
- What is the Reporting or Analytic requirement for this data?

### User Details

Use this section to describe your data users.  Some things to think about (non-exhaustive):

- Who are  users?
- Are they internal, external, or a mix of both?

### Use Case Workload details

Please describe how your use case meets one (or more) of the below criteria.  Addressing more than one use case is advantageous.

- **Volatile or Elastic Capacity:** This solution leverages a 10x or great elastic demand, capacity is increased and decreased by 10x within a specific period.
- **Data\User Gravity:** This solution does not have heavy data transfer or internal user demands between OTDatahub and Consumers.
- **Critical Emerging Technology:** This solution requires an emerging technology (Azure, GraghQL, GraphDB, IQStudio etc)
- **Isolated Workload:** A solution that does not integrate with other OTDatahub Domains

### Architecture Circumstances and Exceptions

Special circumstances or exceptions to the criteria

1. *example* We have not yet decided/identified the solution for the CDC of the data.
2. *example* We are required to use custom code due to the vendor issues
3. *example* We are using batch vs api as user has not capability to consume api's
